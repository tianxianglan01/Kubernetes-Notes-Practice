    "Overview:\n",
    "We're going to deploy 2 applications, MongoDB and MongoExpress. These 2 are used because they demonstrate a simple setup of a web app and its database and we can apply this to any similar setup we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) we will create a mongodb pod and in order to talk to this pod we need a service. We will be creating an internal Service that no external requests are allowed to the pod, only components inside the same cluster can talk to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) then we wil create a Mongo-Express deployment. We'll need the database URL of MongoDB so that MongoExpress can connect to it. The second one is the credentials (db_username and db_password) for authentication. We can pass this information to MongoExpress deployment is through its deployment configuration file (Deployment.yaml) through environmental variables because that's how the applications are configured. So we will create a ConfigMap that contains a database url and we'll create a *Secret* that contains the credentails (db_username and db_password). We'll reference both inside of the deployment file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Once we have this set up, we'll need Mongo Express to be accessible through the browser. In order to do that, we'll create an external service that wil allow external requests to talk to the pod so the url will be the \n",
