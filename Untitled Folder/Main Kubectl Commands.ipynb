    "\n",
    "- Kubectl get nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubectl get pod- get all pods in a node\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubectl get services\n",
    "\n",
    "#### create a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "kubectl create deployment NAME --image=image [--dry-run] [options]\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the pod is the smallest unit inside K8s but you are actually creating a deployment: which is a abstraction over the pod\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment: A Kubernetes Deployment is used to tell Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. Deployments can scale the number of replica pods, enable rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### example: kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubectl get deployment - see all deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "When a deployment is created, a deployment has all info/blueprint for creating the pods: this is the most basic config for deployment (name of deployment and image), the rest is defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Between deployment and the pod is another layer managed by K8s deployment called replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubectl get replicaset: which returns the id of the replicaset\n",
    "\n",
    "The replicaset serves to manage the replicas of a pod. I will never have to create or delete a replica set. I will be working with deployments directly where I can configure the pod blueprint completely to determine how many replicas, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create 2 replicas through additional options\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layers of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Deployment manages replica set\n",
    "2) ReplicaSet manages all replicas of that pod\n",
    "3) Pod is an abstraction of a container\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything below the container is managed by K8s\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the image it uses we will have to edit that in a deployment directly and not in a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "- kubectl edit deployment 'name'\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example: we created a deployment named: nginx-depl. This brings out an Auto-generated configuration file with default values in a text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just a reminder: a deploymnet is how you interact/replicate pods and when we created the deployment we gave it a name and a name for the image. The image being similar to a docker image which is the code that builds up an app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you wanted to edit the version of your image, go inside the auto generated config file in the text editor and look for template > containers > image\n",
    "\n",
    "Check for image version with \n",
    "1) kubectl get deployment \n",
    "\n",
    "2) kubectl get pod\n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, the old pod (version) is terminated and the new pod starts to run with the new image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) kubectl get replicaset\n",
    "\n",
    "You see the old deployment (with an older image version) has no pods in it while the new deployment has 1 pod. We edited the deployment configuration and everything else below got automatically updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "* note I think changing the image version keeps the same deployment but restarts it with the new image version. If you type in replicaset or get pod, the deployment is tied with a unique id and the id differentiates between image version. "

Because of this, you would be working with a K8s config file. So what component you're creating, name of the component, what image is  it based on, etc: all gathered in a config file and you tell Kubectl to execute the the configuration file. You do this by using the:\n",
