    "### Overview of the basic fundamental components of kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "- just enough to use kubernetes in practice \n",
    "- many components, will mostly be working with a handful\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: build a JS app with a database and see how each component of k8s helps to deploy an application and what's the role of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node and Pod\n",
    "Node - a simple server (phsyical or virtual machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pod - the smallest unit of k8s is a pod which is an abstraction over a container. A pod creates a running environment or layer on top of container (ie docker container) because k8s wants to abstract away the container runtime/technologies so you can replace them if you want to and because you have to directly work with docker or whatever container tech you use in k8s so you only need to interact with the kubernetes layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have an applications pod which is our own app and that wil use a database pod with its own container. Pod is meant to run one application container inside of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: i think there are multiple pods (with usually 1 container per pod) per node. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run multiple containers inside 1 pod but usually the case is there's one main app container and helper containers or some side service that has to run inside the pod. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in her example, there's one server with 2 containers running on it wtih an abstraction layer on top of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do they communicate with each other? \n",
    "\n",
    "K8s offers a Virtual network which means each pod gets its own IP address: not the container. Each pod can communicate with each other using an IP address (interal IP address). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example: the app container can communicate with db container using ip address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pod components are ephemeral which means They can die very easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example if I lose db container cause app crashed inside container or the node/server ran out of resources, then the pod will die. Then a new pod will replace it which will be assigned a new ip address. This is a little inconvenient because you have to reconfigure the ip connections everytime a pod restarts. Because of this inconvenice another component called service is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service and Ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "Service is a static (permanent) ip address that will be attached to each pod. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the app will have its own service and the database pod will have its own service. \n",
    "\n",
    "THe lifecycle of the pod and service are not connected. Ergo even if the pod dies, the service/ip address of the pod will stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you want yourapp to be accessible through browser. In order to do this, you need an external service.\n",
    "\n",
    "External service: opens communication from external sources but you don't want the db opened to public requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Internal service: a type of servic eyou specify when creating one (pod)?\n",
    "\n",
    "THe url of the external service is not very practical. It's an http protocol with a node ip address (of the node, not the service) and the port number of the service. This is good for test purposes to test osmething fast but not for the end product. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'd want your url to look like: https://my-app.com (example) with a secure protocol and a domain name. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ingress \n",
    "For that there's another component of k8s called ingress. So instead of service, the request goes first to ingress and it does the forwarding to the service. According to the docs, Ingress is how containers inside the node connect to services outside and exchange information: routes traffic into the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Config Map and Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "Pods communicate with each other using a service. In the example, the app will have a db endpoint (mongo-db-service) which will communicate with the db. Whether you usually configure the db or endpoint, you would usually do this in app property file or as some kind of external environmental variable. Usually inside the built image of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: if the endpoint of the service or service-name changed to mongodb, you would have to adjust url in app so you'd have to rebuild with a new version, then push it to repo, and then pull the new image into your pod and restart the whole thing. This is a tedious for such a small change. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the tediousness of the above example, K8s uses something called a ConfigMap which is your external configuration of your applicaiton. \n",
    "\n",
    "The configmap would contain configuration data like urls of the database, or some other services it uses. In k8s, you just connect to the pod so that pod gets the data the config map contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you change the name of hte service, the end of the service, you adjust the config map and that's it. DOn't have to bulid new image or go through whole cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now part of the external configuration can be database username and password which may change in the app deployment process. But don't put creditals or password into configmap. Don't do that cause it's insecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, Kubernetes has Secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secret\n",
    "Secret is like a config map but ti's used to store secret data like credentials and it's not stored in a plain text format but stored in base64 encoded format. Just like config map, you connect it to your pod and the pod can see the data and read from Secret. You can use the data from config map or secret inside of your app pod using things like environmental variables or a property file."

    "#### Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "Data storage. We have a database pod that our application uses and it has some data or generates some data. \n",
    "If the database container or pod gets restarted, the data would be gone which is bad cause we want data to be persisted. To have data persisted, we can use *volumes*. This works when a volume attaches a physical storage on your hard drive to a pod. This storage can be on a local machine on the same server node as the pod is running. Or on a remote sotrage that's outside of the k8s cluster: ergo the storage is an external reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when the database pod or container gets retsarted, the data will be persisted. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between the k8s cluster and the storage. Regardless of local or remote storage, think of storage as an external hard drive plugged into the k8s cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "K8s clusters don't manage data persistence!which means as you as a k8s user is respnosible for backing up and replicating, and managing data and kept on proper hard ware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens if your pod dies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say your pod crashes or you have to restart the pod or build a new container image. In this situation, you would have a downtime where the user can't reach the applicaiton (a bad thing in production).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the advantage of distributed systems and containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on 1 app pod or 1 db pod, we're replicating on multiple servers. So you would have a second node with a clone of our app which would be connected to the app's service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember Service has 2 functionalities:\n",
    "- persistent static ip address with a dns name so you don't have to constantly adjust endpoint when pod dies\n",
    "- service is also a load balancer, when means it'll catch the request and forward it to whichever pod is less busy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a second replica of your application pod, you wouldn't create a second pod. Instead you would define a blueprint for your application pod and specify how many replicas of that pod you would like to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blueprint/component is called deployment which is another ocomponent of k8s. In practice you're not working with pods, you would be creating deployments because there you can sepcify how many replicas and can scale up or scale down the number of replicas of pods needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember a pod is a layer of abstraction on top of containers and a deployment is another abstraction on top of pods which make it convenietn to interact/replicate pods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you would mostly work with deployments and not pods. So now if one of replicas of your app pod would die, the service would forward the request to another app, so the application would still be accesible to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about the database pod? \n",
    "If the database pod dies, then your application still wouldn't be accesible. So we would need a database replica as well (on the same service) . \n",
    "\n",
    "*However we can't replicate a database using a deployment*\n",
    "\n",
    "THe reason being a database has a state which is its data meaning if we have clones or replicas of the database they would all need to access the same shared data storage and there you would need some kind of mechanism that determines wich pods are writing to that storage or which pods are reading from teh storage to avoid data inconsistencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "That mechanism which in addition replicating feature is offered by k8s' component called Stateful set.\n",
    "\n",
    "*StatefulSet is meant specifically for apps like databases: MySQL, MongoDB: any stateful apps or databases*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deployment fo rstateLESS apps\n",
    "#### StatefulSet for stateFULL apps or Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "StateFULL applications save data to persistent disk storage for use by the server, by clients, and by other applications. An example of a stateful application is a database or key-value store to which data is saved and retrieved by other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "StateLESS applications do not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with that client. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much State saves/stores data, stateless don't. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statefulset like deployment is would take care of replicating pods or scaling them up or down but making sure database reads and writes are synchronized so that are no database inconsistencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: deploying applications with statefulsets are not easy compared to deployments. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### It is common practice to host databases outside of Kubernetes Clusters\n",
    "Just have the deployments or stateless apps inside the k8s cluster and communicate with the external db. \n",
    "\n",
    "So with 2 nodes, if node 1 crashes, then node 2 with app and db pods running and would sitll be accessible by the user. Node 1 won't run again until these 2 replicas get recreated to avoid downtime."
